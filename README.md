# Technology: Your ______ may be disrupted

The open-sourced version of my dissertation.

---

## General

This is the repo for my dissertation for my degree of BA Graphic Design at Central Sain Martins, London. This copy might be different from the actual dissertation I submit for the degree as this is more or less publicly available while I need to maintain a certain degree of authorship for what I submit for the degree.

Feel free to fork this repo and submit PRs if you want. Alternatively if you don't want to go through the process of PRs and whatnot, you can visit [the PiratePad copy](http://piratepad.net/geaoHqphXd) which does not require permission of any sorts to edit (might be more chaotic as a result).

## About

With technology being more disruptive than ever before, what can we do about the probable crisis or opportunities that lies ahead? Is this really an unprecedented event or is history repeating itself? What will happen to communications, jobs and the world order?
