# Technology: Your _____ may be disrupted
### How should we respond to the disruptive nature of technology?

by Kenneth Lim



## Introduction

> The whole world turns upside down in ten years, but you turn upside down with it (Robinson, 1977)

That was a quote by Spider Robinson in his short story ‘The Time Traveler’ and it reflects our current situation perfectly. We are in the middle of one of the most monumental period of change in history and most of us are unaware of how important it is. The current age is often dubbed the information age and I would argue that the current age brings about a bigger social and economical change than ever before, more so than the industrial revolutions before and more so than the two world wars combined.

The information age is naturally govern by information. Information is invaluable in this hyperconnected society because it is precisely this hyperconnectivity that gives value to information. Being connected means we get access to abundant information but by doing so, we also generate information as well. A whole industry was spawned for the need to harvest these information. Government agencies seek these information, advertisers, global corporations, hackers, everyone who sees how to generate value from information seeks to harvest them because now, we are enabled to use these information whereas in the past not only will it be infeasible to gather all these information but even with all these information, we do not have the capability to use it effectively.

Having said all that, information is not the only thing that defined our age. Changes occur everywhere: the way we interact, the way we travel, the way we seek to make a living, the way wars are waged, all changed by new technologies everyday. It is not one single technological event that changed everything, as revolutionary as the Apple iPhone is, it alone cannot bring about all those changes. It is an ongoing series of advances, both technological and humanistic, that drives this change. Creativity is the main method for driving all these changes. Driven by our need of information and convenience, we always seek the new way, the better way to do the exact same thing we did before. We send emails and not regular mails nowadays (when was the last time you sent a regular mail? Last time I did that I wish I could do it online), we look up Wikipedia for quick explanation and not encyclopedia, we watch Youtube videos and Netflix and less so televisions. We seek the new and novel because we believe they could be a better alternative and often they are.

Social and economic status quo are being challenged as well. The end of the 20th century and early 21st century saw the rise of neoliberalism and the phrase ‘too big to fall’ entered public memory as some governments scrambled to keep unimaginably big banking institutions afloat with unimaginable amount of money (Dash, 2009) while other governments struggle to pay back its debts and drag its surrounding region along with it (Dash, 2009). Some say neoliberalism and capitalism enabled all the technological advances and luxuries we have today but some, in particular Paul Mason, believes that technology and information is how neoliberalism will eventually come to an end, the economic models of the world will change as the social structure is shaken as well (Mason, 2015).

The social structure of our society is deeply linked to the distribution of wealth and labour. It may sound like a rather Marxist claim but social class is a reality of our society. The Occupy movement is the demonstration of what a Marxist will call class struggle although contrary to Marxist ideal, it was not the Occupy movement that will shake the foundation of our society nor will it be likely that we end up with a Communist society (Fukuyama, 1989). From the industrial revolution in the 18th century up until now, machines and new technology is making jobs easier and more efficient. We are automating more and more parts of labour and also our lives. We replaced lots of jobs and at the same time creating new jobs that never existed just a few years ago. Mobile app developers, software developers that are so specialized they only develop apps for mobile devices, did not exist 10 years ago because the smartphones did not exist as it is now. Data mining is a industry made possible by the rise of online social media (Boorman, 2011). At the same time, over a longer period of a few decades, technology replaced jobs like scribes and switchboard operator. Many jobs are also potentially threatened to be replaced by machines, such as data entry and in the long term maybe tube drivers and taxi drivers. The potential replacement of the latter two jobs caused much confusion and resentment from the workers and a portion of the public as well. People are afraid of machines, worried that without a human behind the wheel, machines will fail catastrophically.

To summarise, this dissertation will look at the human–technology relationship from three perspectives: first, how recent advancements in technology namely smartphones and the internet affected us as individuals and as a society, second, how the future of how people work will be affected by automation and computerisation and third, how new technology is disrupting the current economic model and in turn the current world order. It is imperative for us as designers to familiarise ourselves with the landscape of what is happening in terms of technology because as designers, we do not work in a vacuum. If the most significant change in society comes from technology, we should at least be familiar with it though not necessarily all of us will wield it as a tool. Designers are always agents of change, hopefully, for the better, we improve upon existing things and design new things that were not thought of before while at the same time considering the relevance of our design to the user and society as a whole.
To start with a quote and end with a quote,

> Technology is … no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing. If we give heed to this, then another whole realm for the essence of technology will open itself up to us. It is the realm of revealing, ie, of truth. (Jennings, 1995)



## Smartphones and the Internet

Can someone live in complete isolation far away from civilization? In this day and age, probably not. We are so dependent on what we provide with each other, both physically and psychologically, we cannot just cut ourselves away from society entirely. A similar question: can someone live in complete isolation without technologies? The answer to this question is much trickier. When we say technology we often think about computers, internet, smartphones etc. The Amish communities can live without all the above but that does not mean they are living without technologies. Wheels are invention of technology, running waters and flushing toilets are enabled by technologies, even digging and using a well require technology. We cannot live without technologies because technology is an intrinsic part of being human.

To those born before the 90s or 80s, they will remember a time when there were no internet, where information will most likely come in printed form rather than on a computer screen. They will remember a time when the internet is a really new thing: you cannot use the telephone while you are online, there were no Google, no Facebook and no Youtube. The same applies to those born before the 00s, they will remember a time when there were no smartphones, a pre-iPhone era where mobile phones are varied and touchscreen generally not very functional. Mobile phones then could barely have a couple games on them and didn’t have much use besides making calls and messaging, later maybe taking a few low resolution photos.

Nowadays, with the power and popularity of the smartphones that combined a mobile phone, a music player, a high quality camera and computing power greater than all of NASA in 1969 for the Apollo moon landing mission (Kaku, 2011), most young people nowadays live with their smartphones almost constantly in their hands. Smartphones, among other new technologies, changed our everyday routine: how we learn, how we consume information and news, how we keep schedules and even how we shop. (Retail-revolution.interone.de, n.d.)

Smartphones and the internet have also changed the way we communicated with one another, greatly speeding up the process of communicating across long distances. No longer do we need to post a letter in a post box and hoping to receive a reply in a month time. Our social relation were expanded greatly with online social media like Facebook and Instagram. Physical communities are gradually being replaced by online communities as we spend more and more time ‘connected’. It is now easier than ever to stay in contact with someone than it was just a couple decades ago by the proliferation of instant messaging services such as Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger as well as VOIP video call services like Skype. Distance as an obstacle to communication is all but eliminated in this day and age.

Social media on the internet is now part of a lot of people’s everyday life. Of all the people that we know, very few of them under the age of 30 are not on any form of online social media, even with China’s closed off internet, they still have their own version of social media (Weibo instead of Twitter etc). The average Facebook user have 338 friends on the social media service (Mazie, 2014) yet quite often many if not most are people we don’t really consider friends, acquaintances or friends of friends perhaps but nothing beyond that connection. Arguably online social media is more about connections than actual friends. In turn, we are now part of a bigger, global community with dynamics on a scale not seen before in history.
This global community created by a nationless internet have the power to drive significant changes. Many of the demonstrations and revolutions in recent years were spread by using the internet and social media. The occupy movement, the revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa, the Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong, all can find their home on social media (Christensen, 2011). For those who were not able to be physically present at the protest can lend their voice through internet and via social media, amplifying what would otherwise be something that can be easily censored by the authority. The ‘ice bucket challenge’ went viral and people around the world are challenging each other to drop a bucket of ice water on their heads to raise awareness and over $100 million in funding for ALS (Dredge, 2014). This scale in which communities of people can band together, aided by technology, is unprecedented.
Some argue that the internet and social media made people to be more isolated and uncaring but if one looked closely, the exact opposite is happening. People band together very quickly online with strangers they have never met before and may never meet in real life to fight for causes they believe in such as ALS awareness. The mob is now more powerful than ever before with the internet’s ability to quickly bring together people of similar interest to act for better or for worse regardless of where they are.

The internet and smartphones are ultimately tools to make human–human interactions better, faster and more efficient. We may talk to the person next to us more if we are not looking at our smartphones all the time and we probably should do so. However, without smartphones, internet and the new technologies around communications, we will not be able to form communities as we have now. It is important for us to recognize how technology is influencing our relationship with other people by making interactions faster and more immediate, recognizing that, we can utilize it for good. On the other hand, if we blindly shun technological advancements due to a lack of understanding or otherwise, the power of the community will diminish over time until only the most powerful individuals hold sway over our society.

Technology is so vital to us as individuals and as a society, while at the same time we enjoy so much convenience from it, it is imperative that we keep ourselves in the loop of the development of new technologies be it about encryption or self driving cars. One way to put it is to say we future proof ourselves but I think more appropriately is to say we ‘present proof’ ourselves because technology is not some up and coming thing, it is and always was, happening now. Just as our next topic, automation.


## Automation and Computerisation

There seem to be an anxiety amongst people in some line of work of a crisis looming in the horizon, namely: automation and computerization. Should we be concerned about the trend of automation of various occupation and what can we do about it? To properly answer the above question, we must look at past trends to identify how automation and the more recent computerization work.

---

Owing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him. (Marx and Engels, 1948)
Reducing required labour to do a task with the invention of new tools is maybe one of the simplest explanation of human evolution out there. The ability to invent and use tools is the greatest human achievements of all and so it continues to be as we are still inventing new tools, algorithm, computers and robots to make jobs easier and more efficient. As a side effect, some jobs require less worker to perform the same task than before. The term we coin for this is ‘technological unemployment’. All the way back in the 16th century, there were already concerns over technological unemployment as demonstrated by Queen Elizabeth I refusal of a grant for inventor William Lee’s stocking frame knitting machine. (Frey and Osborne, 2013) 

The issue became widespread around the time of the first industrial revolution in the 18th–19th century. The most notable amongst the opposition is the ‘Luddites’, textile workers who initially started by protesting but later turn to riots and destruction of machinery, prompting the government then to respond by deploying the army against them. Now Luddite came to mean someone who is opposed to industrialisation, automation, computerisation or new technologies in general. Yet the Luddite movement (perhaps fortunately) did not accomplish what they set out to achieve. It might seem that with machinery and automation, the unskilled workers in factories will be left unemployed, poorer and left to fend for themselves, however, that was not what happened.

> ...despite the employment concerns over mechanisation, unskilled workers have been the greatest beneficiaries of the Industrial Revolution (Frey and Osborne, 2013)

Real wages in Britain during the period 1760 to 1860 rose faster than GDP per capita, meaning people’s wages increase faster than the economy grow despite the latter aided by the industrial revolution and mechanization. (Frey and Osborne, 2013) The reason is that the 18th and 19th century industrial revolution is focused around deskilling workers or in other words: Fordism. By decomposing manufacturing into several small and uncomplicated task that can be performed by unskilled hands, manufacturing moved from small scale production by artisan to become large scale by numerous unskilled workers, thus hiring more people in the process. A one man job at Ford Motor Company in the early 20th century turned into a 29-man operation, reducing work time and increasing productivity. (Frey and Osborne, 2013) 

However for the 20th century, the scene is quite the opposite. Modern automation and computerization means that unlike the previous century favouring unskilled work, the 20th century favours skilled workers. The switch from steam to electricity along with progress on technological advancements on the assembly lines reduced the demand for manual work required. The result of this is the increased employment of skilled blue-collar workers to maintain and operate the new machineries while at the same time increased the need for white-collar worker. (Frey and Osborne, 2013) It would seem the same trend continued into the 21st century with the recent concerns over automation and computerisation focused on what would happen to the lower income low skilled workers as we assumed it will be those jobs that will be replaced first.

To know what jobs will be at risk is much more complicated than it first seem. For example, 2013 study by Frey and Osborne concludes that jobs requiring high level of manual dexterity such and surgeon will not be replaced in the short term (Frey and Osborne, 2013), yet analysts from investment bank Bank of America Merrill Lynch claimed the opposite, putting doctors in high risk category (Steward, 2015). The same goes for care workers with a mere 0.35% given to the probability for computerisation in Frey and Osborne’s study to healthcare and social workers while the broader definition of ‘care workers’ being put into high risk occupation by Merrill Lynch (Steward, 2015). For this article however, we are going to look at the criteria provided by Frey and Osborne simply for the reason that their study and sources are actually revealed and can be scrutinised.

For the 21st century, it is predicted to not be about skills  but rather the possibility and difficulty of making and/or programming a machine to do all or part of the job in question. The criteria boils down to three task machines cannot yet and in the short term perform to the level of human beings:

* Complex perception and manipulation task
* Creative intelligence task
* Social intelligence task (Frey and Osborne, 2013)

For example, a job such as graphic design cannot be done by machines entirely, especially coming up with ‘ideas’, an algorithm that can come up with idea that is novel yet socially appropriate is practically impossible to imagine let alone write because the amount of social knowledge that it requires, that we human intrinsically possess, is already beyond any description of formal logic.

---

Coming back to the question we started with, should we be concerned about automation? Yes, since machines are predicted to replace 35% of existing UK jobs and 47% of existing US jobs (Steward, 2015) we ought to be concerned. What can we do about it? First of all, we need to understand it, what kind of jobs are best done by machines and which jobs are not likely to be done by machines. Then we can better equip ourselves and the next generations with the best skill fitting of the future workforce requirements. 

> Mankind has prejudices against every new undertaking, which are not always prejudices of ignorance. He that only doubts what he does not know may be satisfied by testimony. At least by that of his own eyes; but a projector, my Lord, has more dangerous enemies, the envious and the interested, who will neither hear reasons nor see facts, and whose animosity is more vehement as their conviction is more strong. (Jennings, 1995)



## Shifting Socio and Economic Model

We have experience a significant economic slowdown in the past five years. The global economy never really recovered fully from the economic crisis that started with the collapse of Lehman Brothers (Wearden, Teather and Treanor, 2008). The term ‘too big to fall’ was coined shortly after to symbolize financial institution that was controlling so much of the nation’s financial activity it cannot be allowed to go bust (Dash, 2009), the financial crisis that saw no end at Greece shaken the unity of the Euro Zone (Walker, 2015). From a multitude of recent events, evidently the current economic systems is failing. Popular economics would argue that this is just capitalism’s process of self correcting its own conflict but as a society and in turn the whole world, we cannot afford to go through another ‘corrective process’ (Mason, Pettifor and Blond, 2015). Also the way governments print fiat money and financial institutions toy at the economy only adds to the problem. Debts will only get higher and higher while the crisis will only get deeper and deeper (Mason, 2015). Sooner or later the bubble will pop and it will be a collapse that we cannot or at least we should not recover from.

In its place is another form of socio-economic model, a model that exist in some form today: a sharing economy.

---

Despite this looking like an ideal situation for Marxist, in the words of Francis Fukuyama:

> But in fact, in many traditional peasant communities, raising the piece-work rate actually had the opposite effect of lowering labour productivity: at the higher rate, a peasant accustomed to earning two and one-half marks per day found he could earn the same amount by working less, and did so because he valued leisure more than income. (Fukuyama, 1989)

This is not a simple problem that we can solve with a centralized approach. Rather we should approach it with an internet-like decentralized approach.

The current way that we work stems from the industrial revolution of 18th century. We work under capitals accumulating capitals by trading in our time. Workers are just part of a big machine working for the capitalists who are themselves a part of a bigger machine. If one part of the machine fails, it is expendable and can be replaced by another replacement parts. Everyone is expendable under the system yet everyone is depending on the system to survive. Expending with the coal miners in 1984–85 triggered the biggest strike in UK history because the miners cannot afford to lose their jobs. We are tied to the system that we see no way out of, we are working not because we want to but because there are no alternatives that we can think of. With austerity measures looming with the recent economic crises, not working is unthinkable. The way that we work needs to change fundamentally.

Work should not be tied to monetary value but rather directly to the outcome of the work itself, just as a craftsman make a pair of clogs, the value of the work is in the clogs itself not the money made by selling the clog. In the open source community, development of open source software is done by a large communities of volunteers, no money is involved here, they do it because they believe that it is making the software better. Wikipedia pages may be edited by all but there is always a core team of volunteers monitoring over 5 million entries in English alone (Wikipedia), ensuring no significant amount of sabotage is happening, with most sabotage reverted in under 2 minutes (Viégas, Wattenberg and Dave, 2004), by being open, they can be always up to date and sometimes be more accurate than more traditional sources. 
Sharing and volunteering is not exclusive to online activity or software development. In face of recent economic crisis, more than 70 free and sharing projects from carpool to free kindergartens cropped up in Greece (Mason, 2015). It is precisely the collapse of the traditional economy, with the widespread loss of jobs, that enabled these people to have the free time to volunteer and help each other in the time of crisis. Free time is what enabled all this.

Much of what is possible in the sharing economy is also due to recent advances in technology. Uber would not have gained such popularity and threaten traditional taxi drivers everywhere without providing the convenience of being able to call a ride direct from a device in your pocket with a few taps. Airbnb cannot exist without the internet as they will not be able to reach such a big audience and they will not be able to have such a large community of people providing holiday homes. Most of the bigger companies out there are still tying the services or products to a monetary value but free alternatives exist as well, given the right conditions, there is no reason why the free alternatives cannot be better than the paid ones. Couchsurfing, for example, is an extremely popular alternative to Airbnb especially amongst backpackers and free carpooling long exist before Uber existed.

>He [Ross Ulbricht, creator of dark web store service Silk Road] created a competitive, functioning market in the most hostile conditions imaginable…[Drug] Dealers were polite, attentive and consumer-centric. There were loyalty systems, special offers and mystery shoppers. Product quality was kept high and prices low thanks to consumer power. (Bartlett, 2015)

Even the most impossible market is now being changed by technology. The dark web is home to many shady activities and also many less shady activities such as whistleblowing. Yet the dark web, by providing an open market, is able to shape how drug dealers do transactions. Drug dealing gone from being controlled by violent gangs and mafia bosses into an almost small producer like module on the dark web. That is precisely just how disruptive technology can be in shaping our world. Technology have the properties of corrupting the market value of whatever it comes close to (Mason, 2015).

This disruption on the world order is surprising yet not entirely unexpected. It utilizes the will of the people to push things towards the better. On the contrary, it will be those who shun technology that will struggle. Taxi drivers across the world are struggling to keep up with Uber but if they recognize the benefits brought by embracing technology, there is no reason why they could not adapt and compete.



## Conclusion

During UAL Next Up 2015, we have a couple of speakers indirectly providing insight on this issue. First we have Andy Sandoz from Havas Work Club who tells us to not be afraid of technology and ‘put technology in your brain’ for that is how we can keep up with the progress of the world. Next we have Neil Harbisson who took being one with technology to the next level and by definition turn himself into a cyborg.

We may or may not embrace technology in all of what we do and we are still unlikely to bring it as far as Neil Harbisson in the short term but as seen from the first case study here, we cannot deny the fact that technology have affected and changed our lives one way or the other. In a way, technology, invention, innovation, adaptation and creativity is what defined us as human beings. As seen in the second case study, it is precisely the most fundamental part of being human: social intelligence, the ability to bond with fellow humans and creative intelligence, the ability to assimilate cultural information and be able to come up with different ways of provoking reaction or resonance with other people, that ensured what we do cannot be replaced entirely by an algorithm or a machine. In other words, the intrinsic human nature remained while our routine changed all the time.

We may now be seeing a repeat of history, of the industrial revolution. There is those who fear technological advancements and the Luddites. There is also those who understand the value of technology but also the dangers of it which in a way draws parallel to the Arts and Crafts Movement in the late 19th early 20th century. The latter understand blind conformation leads to detrimental effects and actively seek a way out. We cannot predict what the future will bring but we can anticipate it and prepare for it. Without adversity there will be no evolution.

Throughout the case studies, one recurring attribute of technology is that it is almost always disruptive. More often than not a new piece of technology is used to replace either another piece of older technology (as in the case of software updates) or some kind of manual operation. Disruption is always controversial, it subjects people to what they are not familiar with. Survival instinct kicks in when we are presented with the unfamiliar just as the ancient caveman will be cautious and perhaps even fearful of natural phenomenon they do not understand like thunder or earthquakes. That is not to say those who fear and shun technology are cave dwelling and ancient, but rather it might be attributed to a lack of comprehension of the subject matter, in this case new technology.

Recently, encryption was headlining technology news and more specifically in the UK, the so called ‘Snooper’s Charter’ (Hern, 2015). The law if passed essentially gave law enforcements the power to intercept anybody’s communications and the larger implication is that it provide a hole for man-in-the-middle attack on these encrypted messages by third parties. The tech giants, Apple, Google and Microsoft along with the tech industry in general oppose firmly to the proposed law both in the UK and the US. Rewind 10 years we might not care about it at all but with revelations given by whistleblowers such as Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, the people’s general trust in the governments have eroded because the governments proved to be operating too opaquely and the motivations for mass surveillance proved questionable (Nytimes.com, 2015). Encryption itself is technology and technology that we should not be giving up since that will also means giving up our privacy. As such, technology is already deeply woven into our everyday lives and thus understanding the basics is just a step in understanding the arguments around it.

The reasons new technology is so disruptive can be partially seen in the case studies. Firstly, technology, especially technology around communications and connections (railways, telephones, internet, etc.), allowed more people to have a say in the direction things go in. Those who did not have a say in the matter before are now given the power to steer progress in their favour. With disruptive business like Uber, Airbnb and Etsy, customers are no longer totally at the whims of businesses to decide what they should buy and rather it is the other way round now. Secondly, the whole aim of technology is to introduce a different, probably better and more efficient, way to do things. Thus, it will need to disrupt what already exist in order to replace it, in that sense, disruption is the side effect of technological progress.

To bring it back to the realm of design, what does new technologies means for designers and artist alike? For a start, new technologies have always shaped our industry. Most notable amongst these technological advances are the printing press and computers. Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in the 15th century and as it spreads, the socio and economic disruption caused by it spread along with it. The modern graphic designer came about much later, first as graphic artist and typesetters, later gradually merging to be graphic designers. Computers opened up new ways of designing to the designers, greatly speeding up the design process and democratizing the design tools to anyone with a computer and a copy of Photoshop, creating the modern landscape of graphic design. Yet not anyone with a computer and a copy of Photoshop is a graphic designer, just as having a guitar you do not know how to play does not automatically make you a guitarist.

Computers and new technologies in general challenged modern graphic designers to be more than just a machine operator or just someone good with using tools. Graphic designers nowadays require a much more vast array of skills to stay relevant. They, nonetheless, need to be proficient with the tools they need to be using while at the same time be capable of responding creatively and sensitively to the brief. It can be argued that in this age, it is relatively easy to be a designer but it is much harder to be a good designer.

In recent years, computers bring about a new wave of change to art and design in the form of digital art and generative design. The main idea around it is to create software so as artists or designers, we have authorship over the tools we use and not let the tools we are provided dictate how we design. As opposed to directly disrupting the current landscape of art and design, digital art and generative design compliment and extend the reach of art and design by preserving the creative process while introducing new tools or in this case new ways of getting tools. Besides being a new and exciting field for designers, being able to code is slowly becoming more and more crucial for future employment and the future in general. Governments around the world have been encouraging more programming to be taught in classrooms (Dredge, 2014) and with that trend, not long from now we will have a generation of people being taught to be at least literate in one programming language and with businesses and society revolving more and more around technology, it will be those who can code that have the upperhand.

> When human beings acquired language, we learned not just how to listen but how to speak. When we gained literacy, we learned not just how to read but how to write. And as we move into an increasingly digital reality, we must learn not just how to use programs but how to make them. (Rushkoff and Purvis, 2011)

---

Anxiety exist in some people’s mind about the detrimental effects these new technologies will have on us. In order to prevent technological advancements from turning against us, the bigger picture will suggest keeping ourselves up to speed on the advancements. We either suppress progress because we have trouble keeping up with it or we simply keep up with progress. The latter is obviously easier said than done or there will be no anxiety about it to start with. The initiatives by governments to teach coding in schools are already a good step in this direction. While as modern designers we are never meant to be passive consumer of content and so neither should we passive to the trend of learning to code.

With all the open source community out there, besides using the tools they made, it is important to try to contribute to the open source effort as well. Speaking from personal experience, the open source community can be a bit daunting to deal with. However, for an example of a good open source community, it will be the p5.js community. The community statement from p5.js is one of the most inclusive and beginner friendly guideline out there in the open source world (P5js.org, 2015). The last thing an open source community needs is to alienate people because that is directly opposed to what open source really means. Perhaps, one of the way a graphic designer can contribute to the open source effort is to groom a better and more inclusive community, both for the good of the open source project and for everyone else. Eventually, an inclusive technology scene means that comprehension of new technologies will be more common and thus dispelling the anxieties entirely.
